## Problem Statement
Prism Insurance Private Limited company wanted me to create a dashboard for them through which they can check

1)Total Coverage Amount

2)Total Claim Amount

3)Total Premium Amount

4)Premium by policy type

5)No of active and inactive policies

6)No of claims and their status

7)Claim amount by age groups(age<=24[Young Adult],age<60[Adult],age>=60[Senior])

8)Policy Types and their other components

And all these measures should be filterable through one another

## Steps followed
1)Data was imported to Power BI desktop.

2)Then data was manipulated using Power Query Editor where checking was done for empty values and data types.

3)Two new columns namely age group and active/inactive were added based on above requirements.

4)All the requirements were fulfilled using different visualizations along with the option to filter them using one another.

5)Drill through was used to create a table on second page which can be filtered using Policy Type from first page.
